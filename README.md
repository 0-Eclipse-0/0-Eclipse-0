>I used to code for fun but now my programs serve mostly for Penetration-Testing
and CyberSecurity purposes. I no longer program as much as I specialize
in CyberSecurity so I mostly my programming skills are used for automation
these days. My programs are great however if you want to get into penetration-testing
