>I no longer program as much as I specialize in CyberSecurity so mostly code for automation and staging purposes
these days. My programs are great however if you want to get into penetration-testing
or CyberSecurity, specifically network hacking so below are some programs that
are useful for wireless penetration testing. Many of these programs are older and less
efficient due to lack of experience at the time they were created however I do plan to release 
some of my more up to ones as my time permits.
