>Yes, most of my programs are coded like crap, do I care? No. Why? Because I'm a failed Pre-Med Biochemistry major (didn't fail just wasn't happy) turned CyberSecurity major and made majority of this junk years ago (**some** of it is actually kind of useful) when I wasn't even planning on going into a computer related field. Also if you're wondering why some of the programs have portions that are Hex->ASCII, yes, they're safe, no, I don't know why I did it.
