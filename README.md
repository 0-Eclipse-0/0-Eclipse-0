>I used to code for fun but now my programs serve mostly for Penetration-Testing
and CyberSecurity purposes. I no longer program as much as a moreso specialize
in the CyberSecurity field so I mostly use my programming skills for automation
these days. My programs are great if you want to get into penetration-testing
or cyber-security, specifically wireless hacking so below are some programs that
are useful for wireless penetration testing.
